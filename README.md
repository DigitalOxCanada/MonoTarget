# MonoGame
MonoGame is a C# based framework for making games.  I've never used this framework before so this endeavor is to learn as a noob to the platform.

# MonoTarget
This is a Wild West shooter which is a type of game I've never worked on before so most of the thinking is on the fly without any preplanning.

# Multiple projects?  
Each day that I worked on this project I created a new project for that day.  
This is so the process of decision making can be seen.   
- For more details day to day check out each Day's readme.md file.
